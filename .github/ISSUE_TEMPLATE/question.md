<!--
Make sure that your question is directly related to the use or the implementation of the library before submitting it as we do not use GitHub Issues for general discussion. If your question is general (e.g. "How can I do <xxx> in FHE?"" or "Why don't I get the correct result?"), please use the dedicated https://github.com/tuneinsight/lattigo/discussions instead. 

If you want to keep your question private, you can contact us directly using the following email: lattigo@tuneinsight.com.
