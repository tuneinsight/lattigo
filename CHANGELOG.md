# Changelog
All notable changes to this library are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
- Thread-safety: methods of a given structure (e.g. an evaluator) can be called concurrently. `ShallowCopy` methods are not needed anymore and have been removed. 
- Refactoring of the InnerSum methods: 
  - `rlwe.Evaluator.InnerSum` has been replaced by `rlwe.Evaluator.PartialTracesSum`, which applies the automorphisms that correspond to rotations at the scheme level (and sum the results).
  - Introduction of the `bgv.Evaluator.InnerSum` and `ckks.Evaluator.InnerSum` methods, which have the same behaviour as the old `InnerSum` method for parameters `n` and `batchSize` s.t. `0 < n*batchSize <= ctIn.Slots()` divides the number of slots. Parameters not satisfying these conditions are rejected.
  - Introduction of the `bgv.Evaluator.RotateAndAdd` and `ckks.Evaluator.RotateAndAdd` methods, which have the same behaviour as the old `InnerSum` method for all parameters. 

## [6.1.1] - 17.03.2025
- Security fix: the evaluation key for switching from dense to sparse key must be generated at the lowest level.

## [6.1.0] - 04.10.2024
- Update of `PrecisionStats` in `ckks/precision.go`:  
  - The precision is now computed as the min/max/average/... of the log of the error (instead of the log of the min/max/average/... of the error).
  - fields renamed (`MinPrecision` -> `MINLog2Prec`, `MaxPrecision` -> `MAXLog2Prec`, ...)
  - `rlwe.Scale` has a `.Log2()` method
- Update of `mod1.Parameters` fields (made public, some removed)
- Improvement of the relinearization key-generation protocol (reduce the degree of the shares)
- Serialization of bootstrapping keys
- Lower noise incurred by `ModUp`
- Evaluation keys can be compressed (public element `a` can be generated from a seed)
- More doc formatting 
- Fix various bugs: 
  - `ShallowCopy` of the CKKS bootstrapping evaluator and BFV evaluator not deep enough.
  - PSI example failing 
  - Incorrect reset of pointer in uniform sampler
  - Error when doing inverse NTT with small degree 
  - Mod1Evaluator changes the input ciphertext

## [6.0.0] - 06.08.2024
- Deprecated Go versions `1.18`, `1.19` and `1.20`. The minimum version is now `1.21`, due to the use of the slices of std library package.
  - Removal of all slice utility functions in `utils/slices.go` that are provided in the standard library.
- Golang test cache is deleted before invoking the unit test suite via `make test`.
- Deletion of the `he` package and its abstraction layers for the BGV and CKKS, refocus of the library onto the scheme level, i.e., the `schemes` package.
- Extraction of the homomorphic circuits from the `he` into a new `circuits` package.
  - Simplification of the API for several circuits:
	- Removal of the circuit-specific evaluator interfaces, e.g., `EvaluatorForLinearTransformation`. These interfaces are replaced with a scheme-agnostic evaluator in `schemes/schemes.go` due to the refocus of the Lattigo towards the individual cryptosystems.
	- The individual homomorphic circuits are organized by schemes, in other words in the packages `circuits/bgv`, `circuits/ckks` and `circuits/common` where the latter bundles scheme-generic functionalities of circuits common to all deriving schemes.
- Absorb the `bfv` package into the `bgv` package.
- Rename `mhe` into `multiparty`.
- Slot-wise permutations as part of the `LinearTransformation` circuits:
  - Permutation are handled through `lintrans.Permutation` and `lintrans.PermutationMapping` that induce `lintrans.Diagonals` from which a regular linear transformation can be bootstrapped.
- New ring packing API:
  - New packing evaluator: `rlwe.RingPackingEvaluator`:
	- `NewRingPackingEvaluator(evk *RingPackingEvaluationKey)`
	- `Extract(ct *rlwe.Ciphertext, idx []int, naive bool) (cts map[int]*rlwe.Ciphertext, err error)`
	- `Repack(cts map[int]*rlwe.Ciphertext, naive bool) (ct *rlwe.Ciphertext, err error)`
	- `Split(ctN, ctEvenNHalf, ctOddNHalf *rlwe.Ciphertext) (err error)`
	- `Merge(ctEvenNHalf, ctOddNHalf, ctN *rlwe.Ciphertext) (err error)`
	- `ShallowCopy() *RingPackingEvaluator`
  - New packing evaluation key:
	- `rlwe.RingPackingEvaluationKey`
- Streamlined unit test context generation to reduce boilerplate code duplication:
  - `schemes/*/test_utils.go` to be reused in packages `schemes` and packages that depend on `schemes`.
- Introduction of the `lintrans.Parameters.LevelQ` and `lintrans.Parameters.LevelP` fields and the removal of the `lintrans.Parameters.Level` field.
- Optimizations:
  - Reduce the number of masking operations in `rlwe.Evaluator.gadgetProductSinglePAndBitDecompLazy`.
  - Reduce degree of relinearization key shares in `multiparty/keygen_relin.go`.
- Add `gosec` exception directive to weak randomness in unit tests.
- Fix various linter warnings.
- Various docstring formatting fixes and the addition of `godoc` links through the `[]` operator.
- Updated `README.md` with new package hierarchy figures `lattigo-hierachy.svg` and new issue policy.

## [5.0.0] - 15.11.2023
- Deprecated Go versions `1.14`, `1.15`, `1.16`, and `1.17`. The minimum version is now `1.18`, due to the required use of generics.
- Golang Security Checker pass.
- Dereferenced most inputs and pointers methods whenever possible. Pointers methods/inputs are now mostly used when the struct implementing the method and/or the input is intended to be modified.
- Improved serialization interface:
    - Low-entropy structs (such as parameters or rings) have been updated to use more compatible `json.Marshal` as underlying marshaller.
    - High-entropy structs, such as structs storing keys or encrypted values now all satisfy the following interface:
        - `WriteTo(io.Writer) (int64, error)`: writes the object to a standard `io.Writer` interface. The method is optimized and most efficient when writing on writers that expose their own internal buffer (see the `buffer.Writer` interface).
        - `ReadFrom(io.Reader) (int64, error)`: reads an object from a standard `io.Reader` interface. The method is optimized and most efficient when reading from readers that expose their own internal buffers (see the `buffer.Writer` interface).
        - `MarshalBinary() ([]byte, error)`: the previously available, standard `encoding.BinaryMarshaler` interface.
        - `UnmarshalBinary([]byte) (error)`: the previously available, standard `encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler` interface.
        - `BinarySize() int`: size in bytes when written to an `io.Writer` or when marshalled.
    - Streamlined and simplified all tests related to serialization. They can now be implemented with a single line of code with `RequireSerializerCorrect` that checks the correctness of the above interface as well as equality between bites written using `WriteTo` and bytes generated using `MarshalBinary`.
- Improved consistency across method names and across packages/schemes:
    - All sub-strings `NoMod`, `NoModDown` and `Constant` in method names have been replaced by the sub-string `Lazy`. For example `AddNoMod` and `MulCoeffsMontgomeryConstant` become `AddLazy` and `MulCoeffsMontgomeryLazy` respectively.
    - All sub-strings `And` in methods names have been replaced by the sub-string `Then`. For example `MulAndAdd` becomes `MulThenAdd`.
    - All sub-strings `Inv` have been replaced by `I` for consistency. For example `InvNTT` becomes `INTT`.
    - All sub-strings `Params` and equivalent, referring to pre-computed constants, have been replaced by `Constant`. For example `ModUpParams` becomes `ModUpConstants`.
-  New top-level packages that provide a more convenient and streamlined user-interface to HE:
    - `he`: Package `he` defines common high-level interfaces and implements common high-level operations in a scheme-agnostic way.
        - The common operations in Linear Transformations
        - The common operations in Polynomial Evaluation
    - `he/hefloat`: Package `hefloat` implements fixed-point approximate encrypted arithmetic over real/complex numbers.
      This package provides all the functionalities of the `schemes/ckks` package, as well as additional more advanced circuits, such as:
        - Linear Transformations
        - Homomorphic encoding/decoding
        - Polynomial Evaluation
        - Composite Minimax Polynomial Evaluation
        - Homomorphic modular reduction (x mod 1)
        - GoldschmidtDivision (x in [0, 2])
        - Full domain division (x in [-max, -min] U [min, max])
        - Sign and Step piece-wise functions (x in [-1, 1] and [0, 1] respectively)
        - Min/Max between values in [-0.5, 0.5]
    - `he/hefloat/bootstrapper`: Package `bootstrapper` implements bootstrapping for fixed-point approximate homomorphic encryption over the real/complex numbers.
    It improves on the original implementation with the following features:
        - Bootstrapping batches of ciphertexts of smaller dimension and/or with sparse packing with automatic ring-degree switching and $0$-depth packing/unpacking.
        - Bootstrapping for the Conjugate Invariant CKKS with optimal throughput.
        - Decorrelation between the bootstrapping parameters and residual parameters: the user doesn't need to manage two sets of parameters anymore and the user 
          only needs to provide the residual parameters (what should remain after the evaluation of the bootstrapping circuit)
        - Out-of-the-box usability with default parameterization independent of the residual parameters.
        - In-depth parameterization for advanced users with 16 tunable parameters.
        - Improved implementation of META-BTS, providing arbitrary precision bootstrapping from only one additional small prime.
    - `he/heint`: Package `heint` implements encrypted modular arithmetic over the integers.
        - Linear Transformations
        - Polynomial Evaluation 
    - `he/hebin`: Package`hebin` implements blind rotations evaluation for R-LWE schemes.
- Moved the default parameters of all schemes to the `examples` package, where they are now referred to as **example** parameter sets to better convey the idea that they should not be used as such in real applications.
- BFV: 
    - The code of the package `bfv` has been replaced by a wrapper of the package `bgv` and moved to the package `schemes/bfv`.
- BGV:
    - The code the `bgv` package has been moved to the package `schemes/bfv`

    - The code of the `ckks` package has been moved to the package `schemes/ckks`.
    - Changes to the `Encoder`:
        - Enabled the encoding of plaintexts of any sparsity (previously hard-capped at a minimum of 8 slots).
        - Unified `encoderComplex128` and `encoderBigComplex`.
        - Updated and uniformized the `Encoder`API. It now satisfies the generic `he.Encoder` interface.
        - The encoding will be performed according to the plaintext `MetaData`.
    - Changes to the `Evaluator`: 
        - `NewEvaluator` now returns an `*Evaluator` instead of an interface.

        - It is now possible to specify both the secret and error distributions via the `Xs` and `Xe` fields of the `ParameterLiteral` struct.
        - Removed the concept of rotation, everything is now defined in terms of Galois elements.
        - Renamed methods to better reflect their purpose and to generalize them.
        - Added methods related to plaintext parameters and noise.
        - Removed the field `Pow2Base` which is now a parameter of the struct `EvaluationKey`.
    - Changes to the `Encryptor`:
        - `EncryptorPublicKey` and `EncryptorSecretKey` are now public.
        - Encryptors instantiated with a `rlwe.PublicKey` can now encrypt over `rlwe.ElementInterface[ringqp.Poly]` (i.e. generating of `rlwe.GadgetCiphertext` encryptions of zero with `rlwe.PublicKey`).
    - Changes to the `Decryptor`:
        - `NewDecryptor` returns a `*Decryptor` instead of an interface.

        - `Evaluator.Pack` is not recursive anymore and gives the option to zero (or not) slots which are not multiples of `X^{N/n}`.
        - Added the methods `CheckAndGetGaloisKey` and `CheckAndGetRelinearizationKey` to safely check and get the corresponding `EvaluationKeys`.

        - `SwitchingKey` has been renamed `EvaluationKey` to better convey that these are public keys used during the evaluation phase of a circuit. All methods and variable names have been renamed accordingly.
        - The struct `RotationKeySet` holding a map of `SwitchingKeys` has been replaced by the struct `GaloisKey` holding a single `EvaluationKey`.
        - The `RelinearizationKey` type now stores a single GSW-like encryption of `s^2`, which is what the schemes' relinearization methods currently support.
    - Changes to the `KeyGenerator`:
        - The `NewKeyGenerator` returns a `*KeyGenerator` instead of an interface.
        - Simplified the `KeyGenerator`: methods to generate specific sets of `rlwe.GaloisKey` have been removed. Instead, the corresponding method on `rlwe.Parameters` allows to get the appropriate `GaloisElement`s.
        - Improved the API consistency of the `rlwe.KeyGenerator`. Methods that allocate elements have the suffix `New`. Added corresponding in-place methods.
        - It is now possible to generate `rlwe.EvaluationKey`, `rlwe.GaloisKey` and `rlwe.RelinearizationKey` at specific levels (for both `Q` and `P`) and with a specific `BaseTwoDecomposition` by passing the corresponding pre-allocated key.
    - Changes to the `MetaData`:
        - Content of the `MetaData` struct is now divided into `PlaintextMetaData` and `CiphertextMetaData`.
        - `PlaintextMetaData` contains the fields:
            - `Scale`
            - `LogDimensions`: represents the concept of plaintext algebra dimensions (e.g. BGV/BFV = [2, n] and CKKS = [1, n/2])
            - `IsBatched`: Boolean indicating if the plaintext is batched or not.

    - Changes to the tests:
        - Added accurate noise bounds for the tests.
        - Substantially increased the test coverage of `rlwe` (for both the amount of operations and parameters).
        - Substantially increased the number of benchmarked operations in `rlwe`.
    - Other changes:
        - Added generic `Element[T]` which serves as a common underlying type for ciphertext types.
        - The argument `level` is now optional for `NewCiphertext` and `NewPlaintext`.
        - `EvaluationKey` (and all parent structs) and `GadgetCiphertext` now take an optional argument `rlwe.EvaluationKeyParameters` that allows to specify the level `Q` and `P` and the `BaseTwoDecomposition`.
        - Allocating zero `rlwe.EvaluationKey`, `rlwe.GaloisKey` and `rlwe.RelinearizationKey` now takes an optional struct `rlwe.EvaluationKeyParameters` specifying the levels `Q` and `P` and the `BaseTwoDecomposition` of the key.
        - Changed `[]*ring.Poly` to `structs.Vector[ring.Poly]` and `[]ringqp.Poly` to `structs.Vector[ringqp.Poly]`.
        - Replaced the struct `CiphertextQP` by `Element[ringqp.Poly]`.
        - Added basic interface description for `Parameters`, `Encryptor`, `PRNGEncryptor`, `Decryptor`, `Evaluator` and `PolynomialEvaluator`.
        - All structs that can be serialized now implement the method V Equal(V) bool.
        - Setting to negative values the Hamming weight of the secret or the standard deviation of the error through `NewParameters` will instantiate these fields as zero values and return a warning (as an error).
- DRLWE:
    - The package `drlwe` has been renamed `mhe`.
    - Renamed:
            - `NewCKGProtocol` to `NewPublicKeyGenProtocol`.
            - `NewRKGProtocol` to `NewRelinKeyGenProtocol`.

            - `NewRTGProtocol` to `NewKeySwitchProtocol`.
            - `NewPCKSProtocol` to `NewPublicKeySwitchProtocol`.
    - Replaced `[dbfv/dbfv/dckks].MaskedTransformShare` by `drlwe.RefreshShare`.
    - Added `EvaluationKeyGenProtocol` to enable users to generate generic `rlwe.EvaluationKey` (previously only the `GaloisKey`).
    - It is now possible to specify the levels of the modulus `Q` and `P`, as well as the `BaseTwoDecomposition` via the optional struct `rlwe.EvaluationKeyParameters`, when generating `rlwe.EvaluationKey`, `rlwe.GaloisKey` and `rlwe.RelinearizationKey`.
    - Arbitrarily large smudging noise is now supported.
    - Fixed `CollectiveKeySwitching` and `PublicCollectiveKeySwitching` smudging noise to not be rescaled by `P`.
    - Tests and benchmarks in package other than the `RLWE` and `DRLWE` packages that were merely wrapper of methods of the `RLWE` or `DRLWE` have been removed and/or moved to the `RLWE` and `DRLWE` packages.
    - Improved the GoDoc of the protocols.
    - Added accurate noise bounds for the tests.
- DBFV:
    - The package `dbfv`, which was merely a wrapper of the package `dbgv`, has been removed.

    - Added tests for encryption and external product.
- RING: 
    - Changes to sampling:
        - Updated Gaussian sampling to work with arbitrary size standard deviation and bounds.
        - Added a generic `Sampler` interface.
    - Added finite field polynomial interpolation.
    - Re-enabled NTT for ring degree smaller than 16.
    - Replaced  `Log2OfInnerSum` by `Log2OfStandardDeviation` in the `ring` package, which returns the log2 of the standard deviation of the coefficients of a polynomial.
    - Renamed `Permute[...]` by `Automorphism[...]` in the `ring` package.
    - Added non-NTT `Automorphism` support for the `ConjugateInvariant` ring.
    - Replaced all prime generation methods by `NTTFriendlyPrimesGenerator` which provides a more user friendly API and better functionality.
    - Added large standard deviation sampling.
    - Refactoring of the `ring.Ring` object:
        - The `ring.Ring` object is now composed of a slice of `ring.SubRings` structs, which store the pre-computations for modular arithmetic and NTT for their respective prime.
        - The methods `ModuliChain`, `ModuliChainLength`, `MaxLevel`, `Level` have been added to the `ring.Ring` type. 
        - Added the `BinaryMarshaller` interface implementation for `ring.Ring` types. It marshals the factors and the primitive roots, removing the need for factorization and enabling a deterministic ring reconstruction.
        - Removed all methods with the API `[...]Lvl(level, ...)`. Instead, to perform operations at a specific level, a lower-level `ring.Ring` type can be obtained using `ring.Ring.AtLevel(level)` (which is allocation-free).
        - Subring-level methods such as `NTTSingle` or `AddVec` are now accessible via `ring.Ring.SubRing[level].Method(*)`. Note that the consistency changes across method names also apply to these methods. For example, `NTTSingle` and `AddVec` are now simply `NTT` and `Add` when called via a `SubRing` object.
        - Updated `ModDownQPtoQNTT` to round the RNS division (instead of flooring).
        - The `NumberTheoreticTransformer` interface no longer has to be implemented for arbitrary `*SubRing` and it abstracts this parameterization as its instantiation.
        - The core NTT method now takes `N` as an input, enabling NTT of different dimensions without having to modify the internal value of the ring degree in the `ring.Ring` object.
- UTILS: 
    - Updated methods with generics when applicable.
    - Added public factorization methods `GetFactors`, `GetFactorPollardRho` and `GetFactorECM`.
    - Added subpackage `sampling` which regroups the various random bytes and number generator that were previously present in the package `utils`.
    - Added the package `utils/bignum` which provides arbitrary precision arithmetic, tools to create and evaluate polynomials, and tools to perform polynomial approximations of functions, notably Chebyshev and Multi-Interval Minimax approximations.
    - Added subpackage `buffer` which implements custom methods to efficiently write and read slices on any writer or reader implementing a subset interface of the `bufio.Writer` and `bufio.Reader`.
        - Added `Writer` interface and methods to write specific objects on a `Writer`.
        - Added `Reader` interface and methods to read specific objects from a `Reader`.
        - Added `RequireSerializerCorrect` which checks that an object satisfies `io.WriterTo`, `io.ReaderFrom`, `encoding.BinaryMarshaler` and `encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler`, and that these interfaces are correctly implemented.
    - Added subpackage `structs`:
        - New structs:
            - `Map[K constraints.Integer, T any] map[K]*T`.
            - `Matrix[T any] [][]T`.
            - `Vector[T any] []T`.
        - All the above structs satisfy the following interfaces:
            - `(T) CopyNew() *T`.
            - `(T) BinarySize() (int)`.
            - `(T) WriteTo(io.Writer) (int64, error)`.
            - `(T) ReadFrom(io.Reader) (int64, error)`.
            - `(T) MarshalBinary() ([]byte, error)`.
            - `(T) UnmarshalBinary([]byte) (error)`.
            - `(T) Equal(T) bool`.
    
## [4.1.0] - 2022-11-22 
- Further improved the generalization of the code across schemes through the `rlwe` package and the introduction of a generic scale management interface.
- All: uniformized the `prec` type to `uint` for `*big.Float` types.
- All: renamed `WriteTo<32/64>` to `Encode<32/64>` and `DecodePoly<32/64>` to `Decode<32/64>`, added similar method to `rlwe.Ciphertext`.
- RLWE: added the type `rlwe.Scale`, which is now a field in the `rlwe.Parameters`.
- RLWE: added the struct `MedaData` which stores the `Scale`, and boolean flags `IsNTT` and `IsMontgomery`. 
- RLWE: added the field `MetaData` to the `rlwe.Plaintext`, `rlwe.Ciphertext`, `rlwe.CiphertextQP`.
- RLWE: added `DefaultScale` and `DefaultNTTFlag` to the `rlwe.ParametersLiteral` struct. These are optional fields which are automatically set by the respective schemes.
- RLWE: elements from `rlwe.NewPlaintext(*)` and `rlwe.NewCiphertext(*)` are given default `IsNTT` and `Scale` values taken from the `rlwe.Parameters`, which depend on the scheme used. These values can be overwritten/modified manually.
- RLWE: added `logGap` parameter to `Evaluator.Expand`, which enables to extract only coefficients whose degree is a multiple of `2^logGap`.
- BFV: the level of the plaintext and ciphertext must now be specified when creating them.
- CKKS: significantly reduced the pre-computation time of the roots, especially for the arbitrary precision encoder.
- CKKS/BGV: abstracted the scaling factor, using `rlwe.Scale`. See the description of the struct for more information.
- BFV/BGV: added the flag `-print-noise` to print the residual noise, after decryption, during the tests.
- BFV/BGV/CKKS: added scheme specific global constant `DefaultNTTFlag`.
- BFV/BGV/CKKS: removed scheme-specific ciphertexts and plaintexts types. They are replaced by generic `rlwe.Ciphertext` and `rlwe.Plaintext`.
- BFV/BGV/CKKS: removed scheme-specific `KeyGenerator`, `Encryptor` and `Decryptor`. They have been replaced by `rlwe.KeyGenerator`, `rlwe.Encryptor` and `rlwe.Decryptor`. The API go instantiate those struct from the scheme specific API, e.g. `bgv.NewEncryptor`, is still available but will return its corresponding `rlwe` struct.
- BFV/BGV/CKKS: removed the following deprecated methods, when applicable
    - `AddNoMod`, `AddNoModNew`, `SubNoMod`, `SubNoModNew`, `Reduce` and `ReduceNew`
    - `PowerOf2`, `Power` and `PowerNew` which are replaced by `PolynomialBasis` and `GenPower`.
- BFV/BGV/CKKS: the naive method algorithms for `InnerSum` and `Replicate` have been removed. The method names `InnerSumLog` and `ReplicateLog` have been replaced by `InnerSum` and `Replicate` respectively.

## [4.0.0] - 2022-10-04
- Added BGV/DBGV schemes.
- ALL: added default parameters for LogN=11 and LogN=10.
- RING: prime generation no longer skips the first candidate.

## [1.3.1] - 2020-02-26
### Added
- BFV/CKKS: Added API for encrypting using a CRP (common reference polynomial).
- BFV/CKKS: Added API for encrypting faster (encrypts zero directly in Q instead of QP and does not need to divide by P).
- BFV/CKKS: Parameters can now be created without the modulus P. Doing so disables all key-switching operations.
- CKKS: Added tests for hoisted rotations.
- RING: Added benchmarks for a NTT using purely Barrett reduction for comparison purposes.
### Changed 
- BFV/CKKS: Changed the switching keys from (-as1 + (s0-s1) + e, a) to (-as1 + s0 + e, a). This does not affect the user experience as it only changes the internal behavior, which is kept consistent. However, Rotation and KeySwitching keys generated with older releases will induce wrong results and will need to be re-generated.
### Fixes
- BFV: Fixed EncryptFromSK that was not correctly wiping the memory pool before using it, which lead to back encryptions.
- BFV: Fixed an index out of bound error that would happen during the multiplication if #QMul > #Qi.
- CKKS: Removed some redundant operations in the hoisted rotations.
- CKKS: MulRelin now always returns a fully reduced ciphertext.
- DCKKS: PCKS and CKS now correctly set the scale of the output ciphertext to the scale of the input ciphertext.
- RING: Fixed GenerateNTTPrimes that could return twice the same prime if the initial value was prime.
- RING: The function context.UniformPoly now samples based on the number of moduli of the context rather than based on the input polynomial.

## [1.3.0] - 2019-12-20

- All schemes: New switching-keys and key-switching algorithm based on the concept presented in https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/688.pdf.
- All schemes: New marshaling interface for all structures.
- BFV/CKKS: New Parameters structs and API that enable a better customization and fine tuning for specific applications.
- CKKS: New API for hoisted rotations, faster than sequential rotations.

- RING: New API for modulus switching with flooring and rounding.
- UTILS: The package utils now regroups all the utility methods which were previously duplicated among packages.
### Removed
- BFV/CKKS/DBFV/DCKKS: Removed their respective context. Ring context remains public.

- BFV/CKKS/RING: Removed redundant/irrelevant tests and benchmarks.
- BFV: Removed context QP as it is now not used in the multiplication.
- BFV: Removed int encoder, now only batch encoding is supported.

- All schemes: Coefficient-wise arithmetic using double slices is now substantially faster.
- BFV/CKKS: Changed the name of the underlying ring contexts. Q now represents the ciphertext modulus (with QMul being the extended ciphertext modulus for BFV) and QP represents modulus of the keys (where P is the special primes used during the new key-switching).
- BFV/CKKS/DBFV/DCKKS: The structures are now created using the parameters instead of the context.
- BFV: Quantization during multiplication does not use Float128 any more, resulting in a substantial speed improvement.
- BFV: BatchEncoder has been renamed Encoder.
- CKKS: The scale is now stored as a float64 instead of a power of 2.
- CKKS: Rounding is applied instead of flooring when a real value is converted to an integer value. This change affects the rescaling and the encoding.
- CKKS: Use of one context for all levels, instead of requiring one ring context per level.
- CKKS: New baby-step giant-step algorithm for evaluating polynomials in standard and Chebyshev basis.
