		// P is an optional auxiliary modulus added on top of Q for the evaluation keys. This modulus does not contribute
		// to the homomorphic capacity, but has to be taken into account, along with Q, when estimating the the security
		// of a parameter set.
		//
		// The RNS decomposition during the key-switching operation uses by default the primes of Q as decomposition basis,
		// i.e. [q0, q1, q2, ...] and this introduces a noise proportional to the sum of the primes composing Q. To mitigate
		// this noise, we can add an auxiliary prime P that satisfies |P| >= max(|qi|) and that will divide final noise by
		// that same amount, leaving a residual rounding noise (i.e. negligible).
		//
		// Using a single P is practical only up to a certain point because the complexity of the key-switching (and size of the
		// evaluation keys) is proportional to the number of primes in Q times the number of elements in the decomposition basis.
		// Thus by default it is quadratic in the number of primes in Q. To reduce the size of the evaluation keys and the complexity
		// of the key-switching operation, the user can give more than one prime for P. The number of primes in P will determine
		// the size of each element of the RNS decomposition basis. For example, if 3 primes for P are given, then the decomposition
		// basis will be triplets of primes of Q, i.e. [(q0 * q1 * q2), (q3 * q4 * q5), ...]. The number of elements in the decomposition
		// basis is therefor reduced by a factor of 3, and so are the size of the keys and the complexity of the key-switching.
		// As a rule of thumb, allocating sqrt(#qi) primes to P is a good starting point.
		// The drawback of adding more primes to P is these primes contribute to the total modulus used to estimate the security
		// but not to the total homomorphic capacity.
		// For additional information about this hybrid key-switching, see Section 3 of Better Bootstrapping for Approximate Homomorphic
		// Encryption (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/688.pdf).
		//
		// It is also possible to not allocate any prime to P but then the default RNS decomposition (modulo each prime of Q) will add
		// a substantial error (proportional to the sum of the primes of Q). However, it is still possible to to mitigate this noise by
		// adding an extra power of two decomposition on the evaluation keys. However such decomposition is independent from the parameters
		// and therefor not specified here. See the description of `rlwe.EvaluationKey` and `rlwe.EvaluationKeyParametersLiteral`
		// for additional information.
